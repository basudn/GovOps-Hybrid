# GovOps and Fine-Grained Authorization Frameworks

GovOps is not a replacement for existing fine-grained authorization frameworks. Instead, it is a **complementary governance layer** that provides essential observability, risk management, and oversight that these frameworks are not designed to provide on their own.

## Why GovOps is Necessary with Fine-Grained Authorization

Fine-grained authorization frameworks like OPA and Zanzibar are excellent at one thing: **making authorization decisions**. They are policy engines that answer the question, "Is this action allowed?"

However, they do not answer the broader **governance questions** that are critical for risk management and compliance, such as:

-   "What are all the *possible* risky actions that exist in my systems, and where are they?"
-   "How many times was a specific high-risk action (like a high-value transaction) attempted or performed today, and by whom?"
-   "Is there an anomalous pattern of access denials that might indicate a misconfiguration or an attack?"
-   "Can I get a unified, real-time audit trail of all access decisions across my entire, heterogeneous environment (including systems using OPA, Zanzibar, and custom logic)?"

**This is the gap that GovOps fills.** It provides the layer of observability and governance that sits *above* the policy engines.

To use an analogy: If OPA or Zanzibar is the engine of a car, GovOps is the dashboard, the control system, and the fleet management software. The engine decides if the car can go, but GovOps tells you how fast you're going, how much fuel you have, and if all the cars in your fleet are operating within normal parameters.

## How GovOps Complements Other Frameworks

### Open Policy Agent (OPA) and Authzen

- **Role of OPA/Authzen:** To evaluate policies and make authorization decisions.
- **Role of GovOps:** To provide a business-centric, observable layer on top. The capabilities in the ACC give a high-level view of the policies being enforced by OPA, and the observable events from GovOps provide a real-time stream of all decisions being made.

### Google's Zanzibar

- **Role of Zanzibar:** To model and check relationships between users and resources at scale.
- **Role of GovOps:** To govern the relationships themselves and to observe the access checks. The creation of a new relationship can be treated as a capability to be governed, and the checks performed by Zanzibar can be made observable through GovOps events.

## Relationship to Google's Beyond Zero

Google's "Beyond Zero" (2026) is a proposed successor to Zero Trust. GovOps is strategically
positioned as the **governance framework for a Beyond Zero architecture**.

-   **Shared Principles:** Both GovOps and Beyond Zero recognize that the future of security requires moving beyond static, identity-centric controls. Beyond Zero's first principle elevates the action/resource pair as the thing to reason about — functionally the same claim GovOps makes about capability being the unit of governance, just without using the word "capability." Beyond Zero's fourth principle, automated in-depth investigation, maps to GovOps's Event layer and aligns with SSF (see below).

-   **The Governance Layer for a New Paradigm:** A useful analogy is the relationship between Zero Trust and Identity Governance and Administration (IGA). Zero Trust created the architectural need, and the IGA market segment grew to help organizations *govern* their Zero Trust implementations. Similarly, Beyond Zero creates the need for a new kind of governance, and **GovOps provides the answer**. It is the framework designed to manage and reason about the risks in a Beyond Zero environment.

-   **Enabling Machine-Speed Governance:** Beyond Zero operates at a scale and speed that requires automated reasoning. GovOps provides the essential **runtime observability** and **metrics** to make this possible. It provides the data needed to govern a system that is too fast and complex for manual human oversight.

-   **Status: unconfirmed alignment.** GovOps does not compete with Beyond Zero; it can be read as a governance/catalog layer that a Beyond-Zero-style enforcement model could sit underneath. Mike Schwartz (GovOps) has flagged Google's avoidance of the word "capability" as notable, and GovOps is seeking direct engagement with Google's Beyond Zero team to validate whether the models actually align. As of this writing this has not been confirmed — at least one reviewer with prior Google context (Rohit Khare) is not yet convinced the pattern match is exact.

## Relationship to AuthZen

AuthZen defines the request shape for authorization decisions: subject, action, resource, context
(PARC). It is explicitly neutral on identity-vs-capability — subject is just one optional field in
the request, and can be omitted entirely.

GovOps's capability model sits comfortably on top of AuthZen-shaped requests; it does not need
AuthZen to change anything about its request format. GovOps is a governance/catalog layer above
whatever decision engine consumes AuthZen requests, not a competing request protocol. See
`../why-existing-approaches-fall-short/pbac-without-governance-layer.md` for the related point
that GovOps does not compete with decision-mechanism standards generally.

## Relationship to Meta's Muse

Meta's Muse (a personal AI agent product) is the strongest independent validation found so far for
the GovOps model: a shipped product that built almost the identical model under different names,
without reference to GovOps.

| Muse | GovOps |
|---|---|
| Sentinel | Runtime PDP / authorization decision point |
| Capability grant (Muse's own term) | `capability_id`, with lifecycle scope (one-time, session, task, time-bounded, perpetual) |
| `authd` | Federation Management |
| Surrogate tokens | The identity/credential boundary — the agent never sees real credentials |
| eBPF "tainted egress" tracking | Kernel observability |
| Privsep workers + cgroup credential allowlists | Non-responsibility boundaries between components |

Two implications follow from this mapping. First, Muse's `authd`/Sentinel split is a working
precedent for the Federation-Management/Policy-Management boundary question addressed in
`../../06-decisions/ADR-005-federation-boundary-model.md`. Second, Muse's taint tracking feeds back
into authorization decisions *within the same session*, continuously, not just as post-hoc audit — a
capability GovOps's current Observe-after-Execute framing does not yet have an equivalent for, and
which is worth addressing in a future authorization-to-execution contract (see
`../../02-reference/interfaces/README.md`).

## Relationship to the Shared Signals Framework (SSF)

The Shared Signals Framework propagates security-relevant events (for example, session revocation)
between systems. GovOps deliberately treats this as the Event layer, adjacent to but lighter-touch
than the core governance work: GovOps does not try to redefine event propagation, it consumes
signals like these as inputs to the Detect/Respond steps of the GovOps loop. See
`../../02-reference/components/event-handling-and-response.md`.

## The Unique Role of GovOps

In essence, GovOps provides the **"who, what, when, where, and why"** of governance:

- **Who:** The identity of the actor (for accountability).
- **What:** The capability being exercised.
- **When:** The time of the action.
- **Where:** The system where the action is taking place.
- **Why:** The policy that was evaluated.

By providing this level of visibility, GovOps helps organizations to better manage risk, ensure compliance, and truly govern their authorization systems, rather than just operating them.
